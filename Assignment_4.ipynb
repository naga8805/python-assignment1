It uses classes and objects to create models based on real-world scenarios. In OOP, objects contain both data (attributes) and behavior (methods), making code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain."

        " **Abstraction:** Abstraction means showing only the essential features of an object while hiding the complex implementation details. It focuses on \"what\" an object does rather than \"how\" it does it. It simplifies complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable pieces.\n",

This \"hiding\" of internal state protects the data from unauthorized access and modification.\n",
